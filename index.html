          Here you will find instructions for setting up a local version of the
          bot, contributing to the bot's development, adding the bot to your
          Discord server, and using the bot's commands.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the bot is always considered a work in progress, these documents
          will be updated alongside new versions of the bot. Should there be a
          discrepancy between the two, feel free to let us know with an issue

        <h1>Set up a Local Instance</h1>
        <p>
          There are a few steps you will need in order to set up a local
          instance of the bot. You will need some knowledge of JavaScript,
          TypeScript, node, and git. If you are not comfortable with doing this,
          you can

        <p>
          Before doing anything else, you have to make sure you have a GitHub

            >Atom</a
          >), load the directory containing your copy of the bot files.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before you do anything else, make sure that Node.js and npm is
          installed. If you do not have Node.js and <code>npm</code> installed,
          you can do so from the
          <a
            href="https://nodejs.org/en/docs/"

            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >Node.js website</a
          >. Open the terminal - you will now need to install some packages
          using <code>npm</code>. Enter the following commands into the terminal
          to perform the installations:
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>npm install</code> - This will install all of the dependencies
          found in the <code>package.json</code> file automatically. If this
          does not work, you will need to go through each item listed in that
          file and run <code>npm install [packagename]</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>npm run build</code> - This will build the TypeScript files into
          runnable JavaScript files.
        </p>
        <p>
          Congratulations! You are now ready to run the code locally - the start
          command is <code>npm run start</code>. To connect the code to your
          Discord Bot application, continue reading below.
        </p>

      <section id="bot">
        <h1>
          Creating Your Bot Application and Connecting it to Your Instance
        </h1>
        <p>
          Now that you are able to run the code, you need to connect the code to
          a Discord Bot application. If you have not created a Discord Bot
          application, you will need to follow these steps:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Log in to the
            <a
              href="https://discord.com/developers/applications"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >Discord Developer site</a
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Create a new application by clicking on the "New Application"
            button.
          </li>
          <li>On the left, select "Bot", then create a new bot.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Create a Webhook (Optional)</h2>
        <p>
          The bot is configured to send an online notice, and updates on servers
          it leaves or joins, through a Discord Webhook. In your server, create
          a new Webhook and copy the URL. You will need the ID and Token from
          that URL for the next step.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="bot_connect">
        <h2>Link your Bot to the Code</h2>
        <p>
          Now that you have a bot, you'll need to create a file called
          <code>.env</code>. This file will contain the following variables:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>DISCORD_TOKEN</code> - (Required) - The value of this variable
            will be your Bot Token from the Discord developer page. It is VERY
            important that you keep this token a secret - do not upload it to
            GitHub or share it publically, as this will allow anyone to access
            your discord bot.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>HABITICA_KEY</code> - (Optional for habitica command) - This
            is your API key for
            <a
              href="https://habitica.com"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >Habitica</a
            >.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>HP_KEY</code> - (Optional for hp commands) - This is the API
            key for the
            <a
              href="https://www.potterapi.com/"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >Harry Potter API.</a
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>MONGODB</code> - (Required) - The value of this variable will
            be your MongoDB authentication URI. Like the bot token, this needs
            to be kept secret to prevent unauthorised access to and modification
            of your database.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>NASA_API</code> - (Optional for space command) - This is the
            API key for the
            <a
              href="https://api.nasa.gov/"
              target="_blank"

              >NASA API.</a
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>OWNER_ID</code> - (Optional) - This tells the bot which
            Discord account is the owner. The bot will respond just a little
            differently to the owner. Leaving this blank WILL lock out some
            commands.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>PRODDEV</code> - (Optional) - This tells the bot whether it is
            in a development state or production state - the webhook message
            includes this value.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>WH_ID</code> - (Optional) - This is the ID for the Discord
            webhook.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>WH_TOKEN</code> - (Optional) - This is the token for the
            Discord webhook.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <section id="bot_config">
        <h2>Configure your Bot</h2>
        <p>
          You need to configure the bot using the <code>|config</code> command:
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>|config set prefix [prefix]</code>, this command determines what
          symbol the bot looks for to trigger a command. The default is
          <code>becca!</code>, but you may change this to whatever you wish.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>|config set log_channel [#channel]</code>, this command
          determines the name of the channel where the bot should log things
          like deleted messages, and kick/ban instances.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>|config set welcome_channel [#channel]</code>, this command
          allows you to set the name of the channel for user welcome/depart
          messages.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>|config set restricted_role [@role]</code>, this command sets
          the name of the Discord role your server uses to restrict a user's
          ability to send messages.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>|config set moderator_role [@role]</code>, this command sets the
          name of your server's moderation role. This should be your lowest
          moderation level, as all moderators will need this role to see the
          suspended channels.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>|config set hearts [@user]</code>, this command adds the id of
          the user mentioned to the hearts list, in other words, the bot
          automatically add a heart react to the messages of that user. If that
          user is already set to receive hearts, the bot will remove that user
          instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>|config set thanks ["on"/"off"]</code>, this command will turn
          the thanks listener on and off.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>|config set levels ["on"/"off"]</code>, this command will turn
          the levels listener on and off.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>|config set custom_welcome [message]</code>: This command will
          set a custom welcome message for your server. The value of [message]
          can be a standard sentence, and supports Discord markup - but must be
          kept under 1000 characters. Additionally, a couple of special strings
          will be replaced: <code>{@username}</code> will be replaced with the
          username of the new member, and <code>@{servername}</code> will be
          replaced with your server's name.
        </p>
        <p>
          NOTE: Config settings are set on a per-server basis. Only moderators
          with the "Manage Server" permission can change the settings.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="bot_run">
        <h2>Try to Run the Bot</h2>
        <p>
          The next step is to invite your bot application to your server. You
          can use the Discord Developer portal to generate an invitation link,
          or you can use the Client ID from your bot's application page to
          create a link yourself. If you wish to manually create the link, the
          format is
        </p>
        <pre><code
				>https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID_HERE&scope=bot</code
			></pre>
        <p>
          Regardless of which method you choose, the link will open a new window
          allowing you to choose which server you'd like to add your bot to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have added the bot to your server, switch back to your
          terminal and run the command <code>npm start</code>. If you have set
          the <code>WH_ID</code> and <code>WH_TOKEN</code> in your environment
          appropriately, the bot should send a message indicating it is online.
          Otherwise, you should see the text <code>Activate the Omega!</code> in
          your terminal, indicating your bot is online! Now you can try some of
          the commands to see if the bot is functioning correctly.
        </p>

      <section id="bot_live">
        <h2>Host a Live Version of the Bot</h2>
        <p>
          By now you should have a successfully running local instance of the
          bot. Keeping this alive means you cannot shut down your computer. As
          an alternative, you might want to use a hosting service to run a live
          instance of your bot. We use Heroku for our version, but there are
          other options. Be sure to read the documentation for your chosen
          platform! Heroku, for example, uses a separate setting for the bot
          token instead of a <code>.env</code> file.

      <section id="cmd">
        <h1>Bot Features</h1>
        <p>
          The bot has multiple features on offer. Some of them are automatic,
          but most of them require the user to send a command word. The command
          words are listed below, but must be prefaced with the
          <code>prefix</code> symbol set with
          <code>|config set prefix [prefix]</code> (By default is
          <code>|</code>).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="cmd_auto">
        <h2>Automatic Commands</h2>
        <p>
          There are a few messages that the bot will automatically send when
          certain conditions are met.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>Welcome Messages</code> - The bot will send a welcome message
            directly to a new user in the form of an embed. This message details
            how to use the bot's command and what the command prefix is.
            Additionally, if a valid channel is provided for the
            <code>|config set channel welcomes [#channel]</code> setting, the
            bot will send a message to the channel inviting the user to
            introduce themselves.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>Depart Messages</code> - If a valid channel is provided for
            the <code>|config set channel welcomes [#channel]</code> setting,
            the bot will send a message to that channel notifying the server
            when a user has left.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>Deleted Message Log</code> - If a valid channel is provided
            for the <code>|config set channel logs [#channel]</code> setting,
            the bot will send an embed message to that channel when someone
            deletes a message. The embed will contain the deleted message's
            author and content.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>Levelling System</code> - The bot listens to each message and
            gives experience points to the message author. The values are stored
            in a MongoDB database, and the bot sends a level up message at every
            100xp increment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>Command Usage Tracking</code> - The bot logs each command that
            is called and keeps a record of the number of calls for each command
            globally, and a record of calls on a per-server basis. The values
            are stored in a MongoDB database.

            <code>|config set channel logs [#channel]</code> option is set, the
            bot will send an embed to that channel. The embed will contain the
            name of the user performing the ban, the name of the banned user,
            and the reason provided. If no reason was provided, the embed will

            <code>title</code> - This command will generate a random and often
            funny title for the user who calls it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>trivia</code> - This command fetches a trivia question and
            returns an embed. The question is multiple choice, and the bot will
            listen for answers to the question. After 30 seconds, the bot will
            display the correct answer and announce any winners.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>unrestrict [@username] [?reason]</code> - This command
            requires that the user sending it has the "Kick Members" permission.
            If the permission is missing, the bot responds with a notice that
            the user lacks permission. Otherwise, the command will remove the
            [@username]'s role provided in the <code>silence_role</code> option.
            If the role option is not set, the bot will send a message to notify
            the user. If the
            <code>|config set channel logs [#channel]</code> option is set, the
            bot will send an embed to that channel. The embed will contain the
            name of the user performing the command, the name of the
            unrestricted user, and the reason provided. If no reason was
            provided, the embed will state that.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>uptime</code> - This command returns the amount of time the
            bot has currently been awake.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>usage [command]</code> - This command returns a message embed
            for the [command]. The embed will contain the number of times the
            command is called globally and for the server this command is called
            in.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>user [@username]</code> - This command returns a message embed
            about the message author. The embed contains their nickname, full
            username, account creation date, online status, date they joined the
            server, roles they have, and their avatar. Optionally pass a user
            mention as [@username] to retrieve an embed containing that user's
            information instead.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>warn [@username] [?reason]</code> - This command requires that
            the user sending it has the "Kick Members" permission. If the
            permission is missing, the bot responds with a notice that the user
            lacks permission. Otherwise, the command will send a direct message
            to [@username] informing them that the command author has warned
            them, and providing the reason if given. If the
            <code>|config set channel logs [#channel]</code> option is set, the
            bot will send an embed to that channel. The embed will contain the
            name of the user performing the warning, the name of the warned
            user, and the reason provided. If no reason was provided, the embed
            will state that.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>wiki [query]</code> - This command returns a link to the
            wikipedia article for [query]. If the article is not found, it
            returns the search page instead.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>xkcd [?number]</code> - This command returns an embed
            containing today's XKCD comic. Optionally pass a comic [number] to
            get that specific comic instead.

        <p>
          If you have an idea for a new feature or fix, you are more than
          welcome to create a pull request on the GitHub repository. The GitHub
          repository runs a couple of checks on all code submissions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>Node CI</code> - A GitHub action will check for linter errors
            in the code.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>LGTM</code> - LGTM will verify that there are no errors or
            security concerns with the code.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>CodeQL</code> - CodeQL will confirm that the code doesn't have
            any quality concerns or errors.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Additionally, the <code>husky</code> package will run the lint and
          tests prior to each <code>git commit</code> command, which will help
          catch errors prior to the opening of a PR. To run these checks
          manually, the <code>npm run lint</code> command will lint the code,
          and the <code>npm run test</code> command will run the tests.

      <section id="how-to-create-new-commands">
        <h1>How to create new commands</h1>
        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <p>
          Every command uses the <code>CommandInt</code> interface on which you
          can find these properties:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>name</code> - This property is used to set the name of the
            command.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>description</code> - This property is used to set the
            description of the command, or describe what the command will do
            when its called. This will show in the <code>help</code> command.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>parameters</code> - (Optional) - This property is used to
            define the available parameters of the command. This will show in
            the <code>help</code>
            command. To define an optional parameter use
            <code>&lt;?name-of-parameter&gt;</code>, or use
            <code>&lt;name-of-parameter&gt;</code> if the parameter is required.
            When a parameter has specific values use
            <code>&lt;action (action-1/action-2)&gt;</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>run</code> - This property is the action the command takes. In
            this you set what the command will do when called.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Creating a message repeater command</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            First, go to <code>./src/commands/general/</code> and create a new
            file called <code>messageRepeater.ts</code> or as you wish.
          </li>
          <li>
            Then, add the basic structure of our command. Note that all commands
            should be wrapped in a try/catch block:
            <pre><code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
              import CommandInt from "@Interfaces/CommandInt";
              const messageRepeater: CommandInt = {
                name: "messageRepeater",
                description: "Send a message to the current channel using the bot.",
                parameters: ["&lt;message&gt;: Message to send."],
                run: async (message) => {
                  try {
                    console.log("Message repeater command called!");
                  } catch (error) {
                    console.log(`${message.guild?.name} encountered the following error with the messageRepeater command:`);
                    console.log(error);
                    await message.reply('I am so sorry, but I cannot do that right now.')
                  }
                },
              };
              export default messageRepeater;
            </code></pre>
            Save the file, start the bot (You can use
            <code>npm run dev</code> instead of
            <code>npm run build && npm start</code>), then in the chat write
            <code>{prefix}messageRepeater</code> and in the console you will see
            <code>Message repeater command called!</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            So, to this moment you have created a simple command that shows you
            a message in the console, but it does not do what we want. First,
            replace the <code>console.log</code> line with
            <code>const { channel, commandArguments } = message;</code>. With
            this you will get the arguments of the command, or the content of
            the message split by whitespaces and ignoring the first element (The
            first element is the command name), and the channel of the message.
            Now, add <code>const msg = commandArguments.join(" ");</code> to
            join the arguments with whitespaces to get the parameter that we
            require (Message).
          </li>
          <li>
            After you get the message, you need to send it back to the current
            channel. To do this, add this line:
            <code>await channel.send(msg);</code>. Now you can test the command!
            If you write <code>{prefix}messageRepeater Hello</code> in the
            channel, the bot will send <code>Hello</code> back to the current
            channel. But what will happen if you send
            <code>{prefix}messageRepeater</code>? You will get an error in the
            console because the bot cannot send an empty message. So how do you
            fix it? You need to verify the command arguments have a length
            before sending the message. Add these lines below before the
            <code>await channel.send(msg);</code>:
            <pre><code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
              if (!msg.length) {
                await message.reply('Sorry, but you must enter a valid message.');
                return;
              }
            </code></pre>
            Now when you call the command with an empty message the bot will
            respond with a message saying you need to enter a message.
          </li>
          <li>
            Congratulations! You have written your first command for the bot. We
            hope you are motivated to contribute to the project with more
            commands or fixes.
