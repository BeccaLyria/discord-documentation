          Here you will find instructions for setting up a local version of the
          bot, contributing to the bot's development, adding the bot to your
          Discord server, and using the bot's commands.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the bot is always considered a work in progress, these documents
          will be updated alongside new versions of the bot. Should there be a
          discrepancy between the two, feel free to let us know with an issue
          request on GitHub!

        <p>
          There are a few steps you will need in order to set up a local
          instance of the bot. You will need some knowledge of JavaScript,
          TypeScript, node, and git. If you are not comfortable with doing this,

        </p>

        <p>
          Before you do anything else, make sure that Node.js and npm is
          installed. If you do not have Node.js and `npm` installed, you can do
          so from the
          <a
            href="https://nodejs.org/en/docs/"

            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >Node.js website</a
          >. Open the terminal - you will now need to install some packages
          using `npm`. Enter the following commands into the terminal to perform
          the installations:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>
            `npm install` - This will install all of the dependencies found in
            the `package.json` file automatically. If this does not work, you
            will need to go through each item listed in that file and run `npm
            install [packagename]`
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          `npm run build` - This will build the TypeScript files into runnable
          JavaScript files.
        </p>
        <p>
          Congratulations! You are now ready to run the code locally - the start
          command is `npm run start`. To connect the code to your Discord Bot
          application, continue reading below.

        <h1>
          Creating Your Bot Application and Connecting it to Your Instance
        </h1>
        <p>
          Now that you are able to run the code, you need to connect the code to
          a Discord Bot application. If you have not created a Discord Bot
          application, you will need to follow these steps:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Log in to the
            <a
              href="https://discord.com/developers/applications"
              target="_blank"

              >Discord Developer site</a
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Create a new application by clicking on the "New Application"
            button.
          </li>
          <li>On the left, select "Bot", then create a new bot.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Create a Webhook (Optional)</h2>
        <p>
          The bot is configured to send an online notice, and updates on servers
          it leaves or joins, through a Discord Webhook. In your server, create
          a new Webhook and copy the URL. You will need the ID and Token from
          that URL for the next step.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="bot_connect">
        <h2>Link your Bot to the Code</h2>
        <p>
          Now that you have a bot, you'll need to create a file called `.env`.
          This file will contain the following variables:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            `DISCORD_TOKEN` - (Required) - The value of this variable will be
            your Bot Token from the Discord developer page. It is VERY important
            that you keep this token a secret - do not upload it to GitHub or
            share it publically, as this will allow anyone to access your
            discord bot.
          </li>
          <li>
            `HABITICA_KEY` - (Optional for habitica command) - This is your API
            key for

              >Habitica</a
            >.
          </li>
          <li>
            `HP_KEY` - (Optional for hp commands) - This is the API key for the
            <a
              href="https://www.potterapi.com/"
              target="_blank"

              >Harry Potter API.</a
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            `MONGODB` - (Required) - The value of this variable will be your
            MongoDB authentication URI. Like the bot token, this needs to be
            kept secret to prevent unauthorised access to and modification of
            your database.
          </li>
          <li>
            `NASA_API` - (Optional for space command) - This is the API key for
            the
            <a
              href="https://api.nasa.gov/"
              target="_blank"

              >NASA API.</a
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            `PRODDEV` - (Optional) - This tells the bot whether it is in a
            development state or production state - the webhook message includes
            this value.
          </li>
          <li>
            `WH_ID` - (Optional) - This is the ID for the Discord webhook.
          </li>
          <li>
            `WH_TOKEN` - (Optional) - This is the token for the Discord webhook.
          </li>

      <section id="bot_config">
        <h2>Configure your Bot</h2>
        <p>
          You need to configure the bot using the `|config` command (The bot can
          identifies differents settings for each server):
        </p>
        <p>
          `|config set prefix [prefix]`, this command determines what symbol the
          bot looks for to trigger a command. The default is the pipe symbol
          `|`, but you may change this to whatever you wish.
        </p>
        <p>
          `|config set channel logs [#channel]`, this command determines the
          name of the channel where the bot should log things like deleted
          messages, and kick/ban instances.
        </p>
        <p>
          `|config set channel welcomes [#channel]`, this command allows you to
          set the name of the channel for user welcome/depart messages.
        </p>
        <p>
          `|config set role restricted [@role]`, this command sets the name of
          the Discord role your server uses to restrict a user's ability to send
          messages.
        </p>
        <p>
          `|config set role moderator [@role]`, this command sets the name of
          your server's moderation role. This should be your lowest moderation
          level, as all moderators will need this role to see the suspended
          channels.
        </p>
        <p>
          `|config add hearts [@user]`, this command adds the id of the user
          mentioned to the hearts list, in other words, the bot automatically
          add a heart react to the messages of that user.
        </p>
        <p>
          `|config remove hearts [@user]`, this command removes the id of the
          user mentioned from the hearts list.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="bot_run">
        <h2>Try to Run the Bot</h2>
        <p>
          The next step is to invite your bot application to your server. You
          can use the Discord Developer portal to generate an invitation link,
          or you can use the Client ID from your bot's application page to
          create a link yourself. If you wish to manually create the link, the
          format is
        </p>
        <pre><code
				>https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID_HERE&scope=bot</code
			></pre>
        <p>
          Regardless of which method you choose, the link will open a new window
          allowing you to choose which server you'd like to add your bot to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have added the bot to your server, switch back to your
          terminal and run the command `npm start`. If you have set the `WH_ID`
          and `WH_TOKEN` in your environment appropriately, the bot should send
          a message indicating it is online. Otherwise, you should see the text
          `Activate the Omega!` in your terminal, indicating your bot is online!
          Now you can try some of the commands to see if the bot is functioning
          correctly.

      <section id="bot_live">
        <h2>Host a Live Version of the Bot</h2>
        <p>
          By now you should have a successfully running local instance of the
          bot. Keeping this alive means you cannot shut down your computer. As
          an alternative, you might want to use a hosting service to run a live
          instance of your bot. We use Heroku for our version, but there are
          other options. Be sure to read the documentation for your chosen
          platform! Heroku, for example, uses a separate setting for the bot
          token instead of a `.env` file.

      <section id="cmd">
        <h1>Bot Features</h1>
        <p>
          The bot has multiple features on offer. Some of them are automatic,
          but most of them require the user to send a command word. The command
          words are listed below, but must be prefaced with the `prefix` symbol
          set with `|config set prefix [prefix]` (By default is `|`).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="cmd_auto">
        <h2>Automatic Commands</h2>
        <p>
          There are a few messages that the bot will automatically send when
          certain conditions are met.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            `Welcome Messages` - The bot will send a welcome message directly to
            a new user in the form of an embed. This message details how to use
            the bot's command and what the command prefix is. Additionally, if a
            valid channel is provided for the `|config set channel welcomes
            [#channel]` setting, the bot will send a message to the channel
            inviting the user to introduce themselves.
          </li>
          <li>
            `Depart Messages` - If a valid channel is provided for the `|config
            set channel welcomes [#channel]` setting, the bot will send a
            message to that channel notifying the server when a user has left.
          </li>
          <li>
            `Deleted Message Log` - If a valid channel is provided for the
            `|config set channel logs [#channel]` setting, the bot will send an
            embed message to that channel when someone deletes a message. The
            embed will contain the deleted message's author and content.
          </li>
          <li>
            `Levelling System` - The bot listens to each message and gives
            experience points to the message author. The values are stored in a
            MongoDB database, and the bot sends a level up message at every
            100xp increment.
          </li>
          <li>
            `Command Usage Tracking` - The bot logs each command that is called
            and keeps a record of the number of calls for each command. The
            values are stored in a MongoDB database.
          </li>
          <li>
            `Heart reactions` - The bot will check the ID of each message's
            author. If the ID is in the array provided in the `|config
            add/remove hearts [@user]` config setting, the bot will add a random
            heart react to the message.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="cmd_man">
        <h2>Manual Commands</h2>
        <p>
          These commands are run manually by sending the prefix and the
          associated command keyword (listed below) and arguments.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            `about` - This command generates an embed message that provides a
            link to the bot source code, the date the bot was created, the
            number of commands the bot can perform, and the bot's favourite
            colour. The embed is sent to the channel the command message came
            from.
          </li>
          <li>
            `adventure [action (start/move)] [?room] [?direction]` - This
            command will generate a text based adventure dungeon. To begin a new
            dungeon, pass `start` as the [action]. The dungeon take you room by
            room, with each room having a [room] id value and directions to
            move. Move to the next room by passing `move` as the [action], the
            [room] id provided, and the cardinal [direction] you want to move.
            Each room embed includes a prefilled move command to copy-paste.
          </li>
          <li>
            `art` - This command returns an embed containing a Becca art! Many
            thanks to our wonderful artist contributors.
          </li>
          <li>
            `ban [@username] [?reason]` - This command requires that the user
            sending it has the "Ban Members" permission. If the permission is
            missing, the bot responds with a notice that the user lacks
            permission. Otherwise, the command bans [@username] from the server.
            If the `|config set channel logs [#channel]` option is set, the bot
            will send an embed to that channel. The embed will contain the name
            of the user performing the ban, the name of the banned user, and the
            reason provided. If no reason was provided, the embed will state
            that. Because of the permanent nature of bans, the bot will require
            confirmation before taking action.
          </li>
          <li>
            `cat` - This command sends a random string of letters of a random
            length, to simulate a cat walking across your keyboard.

            [number] messages from the channel the command is sent to. The bot
            will send a message to confirm deletion, then delete that message as
            well. If the user tries to delete more than 100 messages at once,
            the bot will refuse as Discord limitations currently prevent bots
            from deleting more than 100 messages at a time.

            create a channel under the `Appeals` category (if `Appeals` category
            does not exists, the bot will create one with the correct
            permissions), which only the channel moderators and the restricted

          If you have an idea for a new feature or fix, you are more than
          welcome to create a pull request on the GitHub repository. The GitHub
          repository runs a couple of checks on all code submissions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            `Node CI` - A GitHub action will check for linter errors in the
            code.
          </li>
          <li>
            `LGTM` - LGTM will verify that there are no errors or security
            concerns with the code.
          </li>
          <li>
            `FOSSA` - FOSSA will verify that the GPL-3.0 license (under which
            this bot is written) is compatible with all dependencies and
            external packages.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Additionally, the `husky` package will run the lint and tests prior to
          each `git commit` command, which will help catch errors prior to the
          opening of a PR. To run these checks manually, the `npm run lint`
          command will lint the code, and the `npm run test` command will run
          the tests.

          </li>
          <li>
            `description` - This property is used to set the description of the
            command, or describe what the command will do when its called. This
            will show in the `help` command.
          </li>
          <li>
            `parameters` - (Optional) - This property is used to define the
            available parameters of the command. This will show in the `help`
            command. To define an optional parameter use
            `&lt;?name-of-parameter&gt;`, or use `&lt;name-of-parameter&gt;` if
            the parameter is required. When a parameter has specific values use
            `&lt;action (action-1/action-2)&gt;`.
          </li>
          <li>
            `run` - This property is the action the command takes. In this you
            set what the command will do when called.

        <h2>Creating a message repeater command</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            First, go to `./src/commands/general/` and create a new file called
            `messageRepeater.ts` or as you wish.
          </li>
          <li>
            Then, add the basic structure of our command:<br />
            <pre><code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
              import CommandInt from "@Interfaces/CommandInt";
              const messageRepeater: CommandInt = {
                name: "messageRepeater",
                description: "Send a message to the current channel using the bot.",
                parameters: ["&lt;message&gt;: Message to send."],
                run: async (message) => {
                  console.log("Message repeater command called!");
                },
              };
              export default messageRepeater;
            </code></pre>
            Save the file, start the bot (You can use `npm run dev` instead of
            `npm run build && npm start`), then in the chat write
            `{prefix}messageRepeater` and in the console you will see `Message
            repeater command called!`.
          </li>
          <li>
            So, to this moment you have created a simple command that shows you
            a message in the console, but it does not do what we want. First,
            replace the `console.log` line with `const { channel,
            commandArguments } = message;`. With this you will get the arguments
            of the command, or the content of the message split by whitespaces
            and ignoring the first element (The first element is the command
            name), and the channel of the message. Now, add `const msg =
            commandArguments.join(" ");` to join the arguments with whitespaces
            to get the parameter that we require (Message).
          </li>
          <li>
            After you get the message, you need to send it back to the current
            channel. To do this, add this line: `await channel.send(msg);`. Now
            you can test the command! If you write `{prefix}messageRepeater
            Hello` in the channel, the bot will send `Hello` back to the current
            channel. But what will happen if you send `{prefix}messageRepeater`?
            You will get an error in the console because the bot cannot send an
            empty message. So howdo you fix it? You need to verify the command
            arguments have a length before sending the message. Add these lines
            below before the `await channel.send(msg);`:
            <pre><code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
              if (!msg.length) {
                await message.reply('Sorry, but you must enter a valid message.');
                return;
              }
            </code></pre>
            Now when you call the command with an empty message the bot will
            respond with a message saying you need to enter a message.
          </li>
          <li>
            Congratulations! You have written your first command for the bot. We
            hope you are motivated to contribute to the project with more
            commands or fixes.
          </li>

          <h2>My bot won't connect!</h2>
          <p>
            Make sure you have properly set up the `.env` file to contain a
            `DISCORD_TOKEN` variable set to your bot's token.
          </p>
          <h2>I can't get my bot in my server</h2>
          <p>
            Make sure you are generating the invite link correctly, and that you
            have "Manage Server" permissions for the server you are trying to
            add the bot to.
          </p>
          <h2>My bot isn't doing a certain command!</h2>
          <p>
            Make sure your bot has the appropriate permissions in the server.
            For best results, set the bot to an Administrator.
          </p>
