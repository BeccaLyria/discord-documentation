<h1>Automatic Commands</h1>
<p>
  There are a few messages that the bot will automatically send when
  certain conditions are met.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>Welcome Messages</code> - The bot will send a welcome message
    directly to a new user in the form of an embed. This message details
    how to use the bot's command and what the command prefix is.
    Additionally, if a valid channel is provided for the
    <code>becca!config set channel welcomes [#channel]</code> setting,
    the bot will send a message to the channel inviting the user to
    introduce themselves.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>Depart Messages</code> - If a valid channel is provided for
    the
    <code>becca!config set channel welcomes [#channel]</code> setting,
    the bot will send a message to that channel notifying the server
    when a user has left.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>Deleted Message Log</code> - If a valid channel is provided
    for the
    <code>becca!config set channel logs [#channel]</code> setting, the
    bot will send an embed message to that channel when someone deletes
    a message. The embed will contain the deleted message's author and
    content.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>Levelling System</code> - The bot listens to each message and
    gives experience points to the message author. The values are stored
    in a MongoDB database, and the bot sends a level up message at every
    100xp increment.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>Command Usage Tracking</code> - The bot logs each command that
    is called and keeps a record of the number of calls for each command
    globally, and a record of calls on a per-server basis. The values
    are stored in a MongoDB database.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>Heart reactions</code> - The bot will check the ID of each
    message's author. If the ID is in the array provided in the
    <code>becca!config add/remove hearts [@user]</code> config setting,
    the bot will add a random heart react to the message.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>Thank You Messages</code> - The bot checks for messages that
    thank a user (using a heavy regex for multi-lingual support) and
    will also thank that user.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>Becca Lyria Mentions</code> - The bot listens for mentions
    (without thanks) of its own username, and responds accordingly.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>Blocked Users</code> - The bot verifies on each command call
    that the calling user is not blocked. The bot will respond
    accordingly if the user is blocked.
  </li>
</ul>
