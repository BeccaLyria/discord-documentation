<h2>Creating a PR</h2>
<p>
  If you have an idea for a new feature or fix, you are more than welcome to
  create a pull request on the GitHub repository. The GitHub repository runs a
  couple of checks on all code submissions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>Node CI</code> - A GitHub action will check for linter errors in the
    code.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>LGTM</code> - LGTM will verify that there are no errors or security
    concerns with the code.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>CodeQL</code> - CodeQL will confirm that the code doesn't have any
    quality concerns or errors.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Additionally, the <code>husky</code> package will run the lint and tests prior
  to each <code>git commit</code> command, which will help catch errors prior to
  the opening of a PR. To run these checks manually, the
  <code>npm run lint</code> command will lint the code, and the
  <code>npm run test</code> command will run the tests.
